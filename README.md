Conviction-based Stacked Generalization for Multi-Label Classification

ConvST uses predictions as label information. 

ConvDBR is a variant of ConvST that uses ground truths as label information. 

Traditional ST uses information of all class labels at Meta Classifiers. 

In contrast, the proposed techniques use information of relevant class labels only based on conviction association measure.
